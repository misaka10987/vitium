Vitium is a free and open-source software that targets to provide a simple and programmable platform for hosting any TRPG game online. Specifically, Vitium serves as a game engine for content makers to add their game rulesets, scripts and campaigns via JavaScript and JSON.

Our ultimate goal is to power automated scripts to free the game host from miscellaneous activities and therefore accelerate the game progress. This include an extensible mod loader and an entire set of game logic implemented. Currently, the project is still alike with traditional online TRPGs, which are built on top of online messaging and chat robots.

## Version 0.1

Version 0.1 is the first development release version of vitium, which we are currently working on. Major goals for this version include:

- Basic web client user interface

- Player login management

- Online messaging

- Primary, text-based game interactions

## Design principles

- Do not try to replicate every detail from some specific TRPG, in consideration of verisimilitude and difficulty to implement

- Experience of user interaction matters
