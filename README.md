# Vitium

Utilities for TRPG.

Vitium is designed to provide a feature-rich and high-performance framework that is able to host as many TRPG games (makes no official guarantees about other games than DND however), in order to create a more convenient and visual online TRPG environment.

## Design principles

- Not trying to reproduce original taste of every TRPG, but based on reality and the simplicity to implement

- Focusing more on game mechanism than visual effect

- Playfulness weighs less than rationality
