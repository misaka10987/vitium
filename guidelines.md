# Guidelines
### Dev
1. **All contributed code should come with docs.** The docs should be included in the form of inline comments for explanation of implementation and a comment block for the usages.
2. **All development for new features should branch out from main and Pull Request for merge.** This is to ensure that all code can successfully merge with little conflict. For major alterations in structure, all core devs would be informed in the core dev QQ group. 
3. **New features requests.** 
    - Core dev team would discuss in the core dev QQ and place the decisions in the roadmap of the repository. 
    - Contributors can make use of Github discussions and issues to raise feature requests. 

### Contributing
Contributing is welcome. However, the code review of this project is fairly strict. We recommend that if you are not fully confident that the code meets our standard of clarity and conciseness, raise a feature request in issues instead of a pull request. 

### Raising Issues
In how to raise an issue for bugs/crashes, please make sure that you have done the following three steps. 
1. I have checked that there are **no** similar issues in the current issue list, *including closed issues*. 
2. I have collected the logs of Vitium during the bug/crash. 
    - If you are sure that the bug belongs to the frontend or backend, you may provide only the related logs. Otherwise, please provide both. For the frontend, the logs are in the browser dev-tools console. 
3. I have a clear description of what happened *and a screenshot of Vitium's bug occurring (not required but recommended)*. 

Notes: 
- Be sure to black out any sensitive personal information in the logs before sharing.
- If you find an issue that is related to your problem, feel free to discuss under the same issue and provide logs or how you encountered the bug.
